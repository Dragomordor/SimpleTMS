# SimpleTMs: TMs and TRs for Cobblemon

This Minecraft mod is an expansion to the Cobblemon mod, integrating TMs (Technical Machines) and TRs (Technical Records) from the Pokémon universe. The mod allows players to teach moves to their Pokémon, with either a TM or TR.

## Features

### TM and TR Usage
- **TMs :** Teach a move associated with that TM to a Pokémon. TMs by default have 32 uses, and can optionally be enchanted with Unbreaking and Mending.
- **TRs:** Also teach a move to a Pokémon, but TRs break after a single use.
- TM and TR items with moves associated to them (so not Blank TMs and TRs) are used similar to most cobblemon items, with a screen appearing that allows the player to choose a Pokémon in their party, if the Pokémon can learn that move.
- TMs and TRs have tooltips that show information about the move, such at the description, type etc.
- TMs and TRs also have tooltips that can display all Pokémon that can learn that move, which can be scrolled through while hovering on the item. 
- By default, Pokémon can learn moves from their TM, Tutor and Egg move groups. Check Bulbapedia(add link here) for a good idea of what moves a specific Pokémon can learn if unsure.

### Blank TM and TR Usage
- Blank TMs and TRs are used the same way as other cobblemon items which can select moves. This mean, when the player uses them, they can select a Pokémon in their party and a move in their move set. 
- Blank TMs drop the respective TM of the selected move, whilst Blank TRs drop the respective TRs of the selected move.
- By default, all moves can be imprinted onto a Pokémon.

### Obtaining Items
- Blank TMs and TRs can be crafted as shown by the image below (add image below)
- Blank TMs and TRs cannot be found naturally and can only be crafted by default.
- TRs (and rarely TMs) can be found in chests all over Minecraft such as villages, ruined portals, etc.
  - You will find that the types of TRs that drop depend on the location where the loot is found. Nether chests will probably drop Fire type moves, villages will probably drop Normal type moves, etc.
- TRs (and rarely TMs) can also be dropped from Pokémon when they faint.
  - By default, when a drop occurs by defeating a Pokémon through Battle, the player can choose 1 of 4 random moves that the Pokémon can learn.
  - By default, when a drop occurs by kill.. I mean 'beating' a Pokémon outside of Battle, the player only gets a random move and cannot choose between a set of random moves.
  - This encourages players to defeat Pokémon through Battle, to have a better chance of getting a specific move from that Pokémon's learnset
- By default, TR's have a 10% chance of dropping when Pokémon faints, and TM's have 1% chance.

## Configuration

(mention where config is located, and that a lot of options are included to tailor expereience easy for servers or singleplayer worlds.)

(Add table here with all config options and descriptions, ranges etc.)

(experimental config mentions - this option is included but comes with drawback whwn client and server have different options. Recommended not to use, but included mainly for singleplayer users who know exactly what they want)
