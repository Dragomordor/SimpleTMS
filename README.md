# SimpleTMs: TMs and TRs for Cobblemon

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dragomordor/SimpleTMs/refs/heads/master/utilityscripts/images/SimpleTMs.png?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC2QW7LDH5YDL4CNFQ5K5N2AZ4TSOFQ)

SimpleTMs allows players to teach moves to their Pokémon in Cobblemon using TMs and TRs.

### TM and TR Usage
- **TMs:** Teach a specific move to a Pokémon. By default, TMs have **32 uses** and can optionally be enchanted with **Unbreaking** and **Mending** using an anvil.
- **TRs:** Function similarly but break after a **single use**.
- TMs and TRs with assigned moves (not blank ones) are used like most Cobblemon items. A screen will appear, allowing the player to choose a Pokémon from their party if it can learn the move.
- TMs and TRs display **tooltips** with move details, including description, type, and more.
- Tooltips also list all Pokémon that can learn the move, scrollable while hovering over the item.
- By default, Pokémon can learn moves from their **TM**, **Tutor**, and **Egg** Move groups.
  - Check [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page) for a detailed list of what moves a Pokémon can learn.

### Blank TM and TR Usage
- Blank TMs and TRs are used the same way as other cobblemon items which can select moves. This means, when the player uses them, they can select a Pokémon in their party and a move in their move set. 
- Blank TMs drop the respective TM of the selected move, whilst Blank TRs drop the respective TRs of the selected move.
- By default, all moves can be imprinted onto a Pokémon.

### Obtaining Items
- Blank TMs and TRs can be crafted as shown by the image below (add image below)
- Blank TMs and TRs cannot be found naturally and can only be crafted by default.
- TRs (and rarely TMs) can be found in chests all over Minecraft such as villages, ruined portals, etc.
  - You will find that the types of TRs that drop depend on the location where the loot is found. Nether chests will probably drop Fire type moves, villages will probably drop Normal type moves, etc.
  - Additional integration with Cobbletowns (modrinth and curseforge links here) and Pokeloot (modrinth and curseforge links here) has been added to allow for more ways to obtain TRs and TMs if you use those datapacks.
- TRs (and rarely TMs) can also be dropped from Pokémon when they faint.
  - By default, when a drop occurs by defeating a Pokémon through Battle, the player can choose 1 of 4 random moves that the Pokémon can learn.
  - By default, when a drop occurs by ki.. I mean 'defeating' a Pokémon outside of Battle, the player only gets a random move and cannot choose between a set of random moves.
  - This encourages players to defeat Pokémon through Battle, to have a better chance of getting a specific move from that Pokémon's learnset
- By default, TR's have a 10% chance of dropping when Pokémon faints, and TM's have 1% chance.


## ![](https://gitlab.com/cable-mc/cobblemon-assets/-/raw/master/graphics/cobblemon_icon.png?ref_type=heads) Configuration

(mention where config is located, and that a lot of options are included to tailor experience easy for servers or singleplayer worlds.)

(Add table here with all config options and descriptions, ranges etc.)

(experimental config mentions - this option is included but comes with drawback when client and server have different options. Recommended not to use, but included mainly for singleplayer users who know exactly what they want)
